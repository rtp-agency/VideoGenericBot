About
Generate a video from an image using WAN 2.5 image-to-video model.

WAN 2.5 image-to-video model features:

Using an image as the first frame
Motion generation based on text prompt
480p and 1080p resolutions
5 or 10-second video generation
Processing time: 1-3 minutes (longer for 10s videos)
Image requirements:

Formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG (no alpha), BMP, WEBP
Resolution: 360-2000 pixels (width and height)
Max size: 10MB
1. Calling the API
#
Install the client
#
The client provides a convenient way to interact with the model API.


pip install fal-client
Setup your API Key
#
Set FAL_KEY as an environment variable in your runtime.


export FAL_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
Submit a request
#
The client API handles the API submit protocol. It will handle the request status updates and return the result when the request is completed.

PythonPython (async)

import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/wan-25-preview/image-to-video",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.",
        "image_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/model_tests/wan/dragon-warrior.jpg"
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
2. Authentication
#
The API uses an API Key for authentication. It is recommended you set the FAL_KEY environment variable in your runtime when possible.

API Key
#
Protect your API Key
When running code on the client-side (e.g. in a browser, mobile app or GUI applications), make sure to not expose your FAL_KEY. Instead, use a server-side proxy to make requests to the API. For more information, check out our server-side integration guide.

3. Queue
#
Long-running requests
For long-running requests, such as training jobs or models with slower inference times, it is recommended to check the Queue status and rely on Webhooks instead of blocking while waiting for the result.

Submit a request
#
The client API provides a convenient way to submit requests to the model.

PythonPython (async)

import fal_client

handler = fal_client.submit(
    "fal-ai/wan-25-preview/image-to-video",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.",
        "image_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/model_tests/wan/dragon-warrior.jpg"
    },
    webhook_url="https://optional.webhook.url/for/results",
)

request_id = handler.request_id
Fetch request status
#
You can fetch the status of a request to check if it is completed or still in progress.

PythonPython (async)

status = fal_client.status("fal-ai/wan-25-preview/image-to-video", request_id, with_logs=True)
Get the result
#
Once the request is completed, you can fetch the result. See the Output Schema for the expected result format.

PythonPython (async)

result = fal_client.result("fal-ai/wan-25-preview/image-to-video", request_id)
4. Files
#
Some attributes in the API accept file URLs as input. Whenever that's the case you can pass your own URL or a Base64 data URI.

Data URI (base64)
#
You can pass a Base64 data URI as a file input. The API will handle the file decoding for you. Keep in mind that for large files, this alternative although convenient can impact the request performance.

Hosted files (URL)
#
You can also pass your own URLs as long as they are publicly accessible. Be aware that some hosts might block cross-site requests, rate-limit, or consider the request as a bot.

Uploading files
#
We provide a convenient file storage that allows you to upload files and use them in your requests. You can upload files using the client API and use the returned URL in your requests.

PythonPython (async)

url = fal_client.upload_file("path/to/file")
Read more about file handling in our file upload guide.

5. Schema
#
Input
#
prompt string
The text prompt describing the desired video motion. Max 800 characters.

image_url string
URL of the image to use as the first frame. Must be publicly accessible or base64 data URI.

Max file size: 25.0MB, Min width: 360px, Min height: 360px, Max width: 2000px, Max height: 2000px, Timeout: 20.0s

audio_url string
URL of the audio to use as the background music. Must be publicly accessible. Limit handling: If the audio duration exceeds the duration value (5 or 10 seconds), the audio is truncated to the first 5 or 10 seconds, and the rest is discarded. If the audio is shorter than the video, the remaining part of the video will be silent. For example, if the audio is 3 seconds long and the video duration is 5 seconds, the first 3 seconds of the output video will have sound, and the last 2 seconds will be silent.

Format: WAV, MP3.
Duration: 3 to 30 s.
File size: Up to 15 MB.

  "actual_prompt": "The white dragon warrior stands still in a grand cathedral-like structure, its glowing golden eyes fixed forward. The camera slowly moves closer, focusing on the warrior's armored chest and face. It then begins to circle around the warrior, capturing the intricate details of the white scale armor with gold accents. The warrior maintains a strong, determined posture. Ambient sounds and soft choral tones fill the background, enhancing the majestic atmosphere. The camera continues its slow circular motion, emphasizing the warrior's heroic presence before ending with a close-up of the face."
