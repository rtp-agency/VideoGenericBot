About
Gemini 3 Pro Image is a text-to-image model that generates images from text descriptions.

1. Calling the API
#
Install the client
#
The client provides a convenient way to interact with the model API.


pip install fal-client
Setup your API Key
#
Set FAL_KEY as an environment variable in your runtime.


export FAL_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
Submit a request
#
The client API handles the API submit protocol. It will handle the request status updates and return the result when the request is completed.

PythonPython (async)

import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/nano-banana-pro/edit",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "make a photo of the man driving the car down the california coastline",
        "image_urls": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/nano-banana-edit-input.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/nano-banana-edit-input-2.png"]
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
2. Authentication
#
The API uses an API Key for authentication. It is recommended you set the FAL_KEY environment variable in your runtime when possible.

API Key
#
Protect your API Key
When running code on the client-side (e.g. in a browser, mobile app or GUI applications), make sure to not expose your FAL_KEY. Instead, use a server-side proxy to make requests to the API. For more information, check out our server-side integration guide.

3. Queue
#
Long-running requests
For long-running requests, such as training jobs or models with slower inference times, it is recommended to check the Queue status and rely on Webhooks instead of blocking while waiting for the result.

Submit a request
#
The client API provides a convenient way to submit requests to the model.

PythonPython (async)

import fal_client

handler = fal_client.submit(
    "fal-ai/nano-banana-pro/edit",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "make a photo of the man driving the car down the california coastline",
        "image_urls": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/nano-banana-edit-input.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/falserverless/example_inputs/nano-banana-edit-input-2.png"]
    },
    webhook_url="https://optional.webhook.url/for/results",
)

request_id = handler.request_id
Fetch request status
#
You can fetch the status of a request to check if it is completed or still in progress.

PythonPython (async)

status = fal_client.status("fal-ai/nano-banana-pro/edit", request_id, with_logs=True)
Get the result
#
Once the request is completed, you can fetch the result. See the Output Schema for the expected result format.

PythonPython (async)

result = fal_client.result("fal-ai/nano-banana-pro/edit", request_id)
4. Files
#
Some attributes in the API accept file URLs as input. Whenever that's the case you can pass your own URL or a Base64 data URI.

Data URI (base64)
#
You can pass a Base64 data URI as a file input. The API will handle the file decoding for you. Keep in mind that for large files, this alternative although convenient can impact the request performance.

Hosted files (URL)
#
You can also pass your own URLs as long as they are publicly accessible. Be aware that some hosts might block cross-site requests, rate-limit, or consider the request as a bot.

Uploading files
#
We provide a convenient file storage that allows you to upload files and use them in your requests. You can upload files using the client API and use the returned URL in your requests.

PythonPython (async)

url = fal_client.upload_file("path/to/file")
Read more about file handling in our file upload guide.

5. Schema
#
Input
#
prompt string
The prompt for image editing.

num_images integer
The number of images to generate. Default value: 1

aspect_ratio AspectRatioEnum
The aspect ratio of the generated image. Default value: "auto"

Possible enum values: auto, 21:9, 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 1:1, 4:5, 3:4, 2:3, 9:16

output_format OutputFormatEnum
The format of the generated image. Default value: "png"

Possible enum values: jpeg, png, webp

sync_mode boolean
If True, the media will be returned as a data URI and the output data won't be available in the request history.

image_urls list<string>
The URLs of the images to use for image-to-image generation or image editing.

resolution ResolutionEnum
The resolution of the image to generate. Default value: "1K"

Possible enum values: 1K, 2K, 4K

limit_generations boolean
Experimental parameter to limit the number of generations from each round of prompting to 1. Set to True to to disregard any instructions in the prompt regarding the number of images to generate.

enable_web_search boolean
Enable web search for the image generation task. This will allow the model to use the latest information from the web to generate the image.
